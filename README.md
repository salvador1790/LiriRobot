# LiriRobot

1) Liri is a text recognition node command line application that takes in a command in the form of text and returns the desired query. This application aims to be used within the command line to be able to get information about Songs/Movies without having to use your browser. 

2) Liri can take the following commands:
    spotify-this-song
    movie-this
    do-what-it-says

3) How to run Liri:
    Command 1: spotify-this-song (search query)
        -This command will take in your query (the name of a song) and it will return you information about the song plus a link to preview it.
    Command 2: movie-this (search query)
        -This command will take in your search query (the name of a movie) and it will return you information about the film. 
    Command 3: do-what-it-says
        -This command does not require a  search query. It will read the content of random.txt file and it will pass the content of that file as the search query. It defaults to search for "I want it that way" by Backstreet Boys.
